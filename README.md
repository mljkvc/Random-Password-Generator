It's a python script that generates strong 16 random character passwords over and over.

You can run it by positioning yourself in PasswordGenerator/ and running ./program in terminal.
When you press the button Stop, you will ge new random password evey time, additional feature i added is that password will be automaticaly copied in your clipboard if you have installed pyperclip library for python3

I used it as a practice to get to know tkinter library in python and to save myself time while searching on the google for new passwords.
